React components are building blocks of react UI. Regular apps are composed of multiple componenets which are rendered. To create a component all we have to do is create a variable and use React function.React.createClass has bunch of methods. We can also add our own methods. To render we use render method. Render method inside react accepts that we return some JSX code that gets rendered in browser.

render must return only one root parent element. If we use two elements it will show error. 

Then we pass our component in reactDOM.render.


JSX is one of the most confusing things about react. You go to babeljs.io/repl. We can write our code there and see what changes occur.
