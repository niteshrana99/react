We will talk about stateless componenets. Example about.jsx is presentational component i.e it does not changes anything.  So when we have a simple presentation component we can use stateless function component as well. That is instaed of calling react.create class and then defining the render method we can define it like shown in about.jsx. We declare a fxn and argument of function are props that gets passed on, and we return jsx.  Similarly we can do it for stateless components, example.jsx and all.
